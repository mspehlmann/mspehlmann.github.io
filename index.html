                    <p>I am an exploration geologist with 10 years of experience across Alaska.
                        This has provided me with a deep understanding of greenstone gold, VMS, skarn,
                        and most recently, ultramafic layered intrusion deposit models and how 
                        they manifest in Alaska. Recently, I decided to return to school to pursue my 
                        interest in geostatistics, particularly as applied to domain modeling and resource 
                        estimation. I am currently a second-year graduate student in statistics at the University of Alaska 
                        Fairbanks. My research interests include exploring the applicability of process 
                        convolutions for generating resource estimations and identifying exploration 
                        targets.

                <p>I am an independent geological consultant specializing in project management 
                    across Alaska. My decade of experience as a geologist has made me a versatile asset, 
                    whether for early-stage exploration projects or active production sites. I am skilled 
                    in managing remote exploration programs and production geology at operating 
                    mines. I excel at developing greenfield exploration programs, from geological 
                    mapping to geophysics, as well as conducting first-pass drill programs. As my 
                    career advances, I am increasingly focused on applying my statistical expertise 
                    to exploration challenges. I am particularly interested in developing and applying 
                    statistical or geostatistical tools to aid in target generation.
