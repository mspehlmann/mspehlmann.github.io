                    <p>I was an operations lead for KoBold's Skolai Project in the Alaska Range. In this role,
                        I oversaw all field and camp activities for a geological reconnaissance program and 
                        a ground EM survey. This was my first experience working with an ultramafic layered intrusion deposit model.
                        I made the most of my free time to learn about this new deposit type by accompanying the field geologists whenever possible.</p>

                    <p>I was the project geologist for the Palmer Project during the 2023 infill drill program. This is a 
                        VMS deposit located in the Wrangellia Terrane of Southeast Alaska. My primary responsibilities included ensuring 
                        the drill program ran efficiently, overseeing core logging, and ensuring samples were dispatched regularly.

                        During the winter, I transitioned to overseeing the infill drilling program for what is now the Manh Choh mine.
                        This was my first experience conducting a surface drill program in the harsh conditions of interior Alaska.

                    <p>Shortly after finishing my undergraduate degree, I took a contract position in Juneau with Coeur Alaska in the fall of 2014.
                        I assisted the database manager with QA/QC of historic assays and maps. When the contract ended in the winter, 
                        I continued as a geotech to build my geology skills, often working in the roles of ore control geologist and core logger.
                        From 2015 to 2017, I progressed into a full-time role as a mine geologist.<br><br>
                        As a mine geologist, I was responsible for daily ore control in a narrow vein underground setting, 
                        planning infill and stope fence drilling, and making stope resource estimates. During this period, I developed a keen interest 
                        in implicit domaining and geostatistics. In 2019, I presented my structural model of the controlling faults at Kensington 
                        at the Alaska Miner's Association convention.<br><br>At the end of 2020, I was promoted to senior exploration geologist.
                        I led an effort to review the geochemistry of the diorite pluton, identifying a unique phase change previously undocumented.
                        Given that the Berners Bay district has been intermittently mined for over a century, I investigated soil geochemistry data 
                        contaminated by tram lines. Using multivariate statistical anomaly detection, I identified genuine geological anomalies, 
                        leading to a drill target that intercepted a vein.
